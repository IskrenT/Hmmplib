What is Hmmplib?
================
##Hmmplib is an open source C library solution to HMM ( Hidden Markov Model )

##Hmmplib features:
* Algorithmic and abstract solutions to the problems in HMM written in C.
* Muty-core thread level parallelism via OpenMP for the abstract level.
* Optimised algorithms and memory access.
* File I/O interface.

##Specifics of Hmmplib:
* Only operates with discrete emission alphabet and probability variables.
* Use multiple models and sequences for: evaluation, decoding and learning.

Check @ref general for detailed explanation on how to use the library.
